# Credit-Risk-Prediction-Model
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict credit risk, which is the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their debt obligations. By analyzing historical loan data, the model will identify patterns and relationships between various applicant attributes and the risk of default. The primary goal is to provide a reliable tool for financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions, minimize potential losses, and promote responsible lending practices.

Objectives
Data Preprocessing and Exploration: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, handle missing values and outliers, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into the factors influencing credit risk.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing data to improve model performance and better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

Model Development: Build and train several machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict loan default.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC score, to select the best-performing model.

Model Interpretation: Analyze the most important features that contribute to credit risk predictions to provide actionable insights for business stakeholders.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "German Credit Data" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 20 features and a target variable indicating whether a loan is "Good" (low risk) or "Bad" (high risk). The features include both categorical and numerical data, covering aspects such as account status, credit history, loan purpose, and personal information of the applicants.

Features:

Checking account status

Duration of credit

Credit history

Purpose of the loan

Credit amount

Savings account/bonds

Present employment since

And more...

Target Variable:

Risk: Good or Bad

Methodology
Data Loading and Initial Analysis: The dataset is loaded, and an initial assessment is conducted to understand its structure and identify any immediate data quality issues.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical tests are used to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable. This helps in understanding the key drivers of credit risk.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Impute or remove missing data where necessary.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features into a numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Feature Scaling: Standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which is important for certain machine learning algorithms.

Model Training and Tuning:

The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets.

Several classification models are trained on the training data.

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like GridSearchCV to find the optimal settings for each model.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on the test set using various performance metrics. The model with the best overall performance is selected.
